# Afterimage effect simulation using a webcam
After image illusion simulation in python and c++ using opencv.

The idea is to simulate the human retina in its response to saturated and stationary stimulus that causes af6erimages. 
The point is to argue that the color of the aferimage is indeed the complementary color and not the supplementary as supported by many authors (see Koenderink's experiment).


The C++ version (a lot faster than Python) works also with the Lilac chaser:
